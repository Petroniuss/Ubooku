Web service for storing books.

This is basically a toy project of mine created to explore technologies and teach myself web development.

## Technology stack

Client was created using angular framework and typescript.

For backend I went with:

- java 11 (good old java ;) )
- Spring Boot (mainstream framework for backend in java)
- GCS (Google Cloud Storage) - blob store for pdfs and book thumbnails.
- MonogoDB - NoSQL database for storing user information.

Application was deployed on heroku.
